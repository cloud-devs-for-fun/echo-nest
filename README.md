## Project: Echo Nest -The Resonance of Ideas

 ## Concept
EchoNest is a discussion-first forum platform where conversations don’t just happen—they resonate, evolve, and grow. Think of it as a living nest of ideas, where each comment adds a layer, echoing through the community.

Unlike traditional forums where posts get buried or become inactive, EchoNest promotes ongoing dialogue through intelligent threading, community-powered highlights, and resurfacing valuable discussions.
